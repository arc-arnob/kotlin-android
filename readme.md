| 2    | **Architecture & DI**                 | ‚Ä¢ MVVM pattern<br>‚Ä¢ ViewModel & LiveData/Flow<br>‚Ä¢ Hilt for dependency injection        | Refactor to MVVM; inject your `ExpenseRepository` via Hilt.                    |
| 2    | **Networking & Coroutines**           | ‚Ä¢ Retrofit + serialization (Moshi/Kotlinx)<br>‚Ä¢ Kotlin Coroutines + Flow                | Fetch currency rates from a public API and display converted amounts.          |
| 2    | **Authentication & Cloud Sync**       | ‚Ä¢ Firebase Auth (email/Google)<br>‚Ä¢ Firestore basics<br>‚Ä¢ Offline‚Äëfirst patterns        | Let users sign in & sync their expenses to Firestore.                          |

### How to Use This Roadmap

1. **Block weekly time** (e.g. 5‚Äì10¬†hours/week).
2. **Follow each week‚Äôs goals**‚Äîwatch one tutorial + read docs + write code/tests.
3. **Commit early and often**: push to GitHub with meaningful commit messages.
4. **Demo each milestone**: record a 1‚Äì2¬†minute screencast to show off features.
5. **Iterate**: if a concept feels shaky, spend an extra day practicing small exercises.
